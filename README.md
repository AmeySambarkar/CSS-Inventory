# CSS-Inventory
Collection of CSS Animations

This project was created for Hacktoberst at MIT-ADT, but anyone is welcome to participate! It showcases CSS animations inspired by ZTM's Animation Challenge.

## RULES:
0. Fork the repository, clone your copy as demonstrated [here](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions), and make further changes in your locally cloned copy.
1. Create a folder named after yourself in the Cards directory.
2. Write your `my_animation.html` and `my_animation.css` files containing your animation, and link them using `<style>`. No `<script>` is allowed, just pure CSS. You can be as imaginative as you want with your animation.
3. After completing the `.html` and `.css` files, screen record your animation, export it as a gif, and save it inside your folder as `"your_name.gif"`. I recommend using OBS Studio to record and an online gif converter or Microsoft ClipChamp, which can easily export a screen-recorded video as a gif.
4. Great! You've made it halfway if you've done all this. Now, go to `index.js`, and in the cards array, add your element separated by a comma:

```javascript
{
  artName: "name_your_animation",
  pageLink: "./Cards/your_name/my_animation.html",
  imageLink: "./Cards/your_name/your_gif_name.gif",
  author: "your_name",
  githubLink: 'https://github.com/your_username'
}
```
All done!! Commit and push your changes! Once done, send a pull request for review. If you followed the steps correctly, it'll be merged soon, and your changes should be reflected on the main website! 
BE CAREFUL WHILE LINKING YOUR CREATION; USE YOUR OWN FOLDER.
NOTE: PLEASE REMEMBER YOU NEED TO ADD A GIF OF YOUR ANIMATION TO MAKE IT SHOW UP ON THE MAIN WEBSITE. THANKS!
