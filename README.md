# CSS-Inventory
Collection of CSS Animations!

Made for Hacktoberst at MIT-ADT but anyone is welcome to participate!!
This is basically a display of CSS animations inspired by ZTM's Animation Challenge!

## RULES:
1. Make a folder after yourself in the Cards directory
2. Write your `my_animation.html` and `my_animation.css` files containing your animation and link them using `<style>`; no `<script>` allowed! Just pure CSS. You can be as imaginative as you want with your animation.
3. Once done with the `.html` and `.css` files, screen record your animation and export it as a gif and save it inside your folder as `"your_name.gif"`. I'd recommend using OBS Studio to record then an online gif converter OR Microsoft ClipChamp - which can export a screen recorded video as a gif easily!  
4. Great! You've made it halfway if you've done all this. Now just go to `index.js` and in the cards array, add your element separated by a comma:

```javascript
{
  artName: "name_your_animation",
  pageLink: "./Cards/your_name/my_animation.html",
  imageLink: "./Cards/your_name/your_gif_name.gif",
  author: "your_name",
  githubLink: 'https://github.com/your_username'
}

All done!! Your changes should be reflected soon! PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHILE LINKING YOUR CREATION, USE YOUR OWN FOLDER.
NOTE: PLEASE REMEMBER YOU NEED TO ADD A GIF OF YOUR ANIMATION TO MAKE IT SHOW UP ON THE MAIN WEBSITE. THANKS!
